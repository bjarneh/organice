 What
------------------------------------------------------------

a build tool based on godag (http://godag.googlecode.com)
for c, in c. not the most mature system at the moment.




------------------------------------------------------------
 Install
------------------------------------------------------------

 $ make            # will build the binary in: bin/oc


this can be moved somewhere it can be found, i.e.
inside a directory pointed to by the PATH variable,
or the 'bin' directory can be added to the PATH variable.
the target 'localinstall' will copy the binary to
$HOME/bin if it exists. 

 $ make localinstall 

is the same as

 $ make && cp bin/oc $HOME/bin



------------------------------------------------------------
 Try
------------------------------------------------------------

once you have built the binary you can test it out.
these commands assumes 'oc' can be found inside the $PATH


  $ oc clean          # removes all the objects generated
  $ oc test           # runs unit-tests
  $ oc help           # prints the help menu
  $ oc -o program     # builds 'oc' and names it 'program'




------------------------------------------------------------
 Organise
------------------------------------------------------------

a package in (this context) is a header file and a
source file, which apart from their suffix has the
same name and resides in the same directory.

    src/some/path/that.h
    src/some/path/that.c

these two files would be considered part of the same 
package, and these are the only two files "that" package
can contain.

a test package is a normal package which filenames end
with '_test.h' and '_test.c'. 

    src/some/path/test_that.h
    src/some/path/test_that.c

this would be considered a test package, and would not
be compiled during a normal build.
